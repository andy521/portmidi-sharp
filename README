This is an attempt to use portmidi on Mono.

Looks like portmidi project itself is trying to support managed
solution, but it looks bogus since it seems trying to use C++/CLI
mixed solution which is no-go for Mono.


You need shared library version of portmidi, which I also posted
to portmidi mailing list:

It might be better to have this integrated into portmidi itself
but so far I haven't dug in depth to get it into there yet. Feel
free to do it if you are interested and you can :)
