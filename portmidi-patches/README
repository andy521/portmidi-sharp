The patches are to autotoolize portmidi so that hopefully we can build
portmidi as dynamic library in all platforms (like mono does).

Extract appropriate archive under portmidi/trunk directory in your copy
of portmedia svn repository.

Though I haven't improved them to build all tests, and cygwin build script
is still not complete. So it is unofficial (not even posted to portmedia
community) yet.
